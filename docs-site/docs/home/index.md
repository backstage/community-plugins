# Community Plugin Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation hub for **Backstage Community Plugins**.

---

## How It Works

Each workspace in the repository can include a `docs/` folder. During site generation, any workspace with a `docs/` folder is automatically picked up and included in the navigation.

This helps standardize plugin documentation across the monorepo â€” whether you're documenting usage, APIs, or configuration steps.
