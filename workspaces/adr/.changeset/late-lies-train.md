Change status badge (tag/chip) to more colorful variants:

1. "good" labels for the status "accepted" from the primary theme color to the success palette color.
2. "warning" labels for the status "deprecated" from the secondary theme color to the warning palette color.
3. "dangerous" labels for the status "rejected" from the secondary theme color to the error palette color.
