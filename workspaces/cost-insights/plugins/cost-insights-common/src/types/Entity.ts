/**
 *
 * An entity is a tree-like structure that represents any unique
 * product or service that generates cost over a fixed period of time.
 * An entity could be atomic or composite. An atomic entity is indivisible
 * and cannot be broken into sub-entities.
 *
 * A composite entity is divided into sub-entities that account for portions
 * of the total cost **over the same time period**. The root entity is
 * expected to only have _one_ Record consisting of the sub-entities to display
 * in the product panel (keyed by the entity type, such as "service" for
 * compute entities).
 *
 * The root sub-entities may have multiple breakdowns  - for example, a
 * breakdown of an entity cost by SKU vs deployment environment. The sum
 * aggregated cost of each keyed breakdown should equal the sub-entity's cost.
 *
 * Entities with null ids are considered "unlabeled" - costs without attribution.
 * If an entity is a composite, it may only have one (1) null child but may have any number of
 * null grandchildren.
 *
 * @public
 *
 * @example
 * Here's an example composite entity:
 * ```
 * const compositeEntity = {
 *   id: 'product',
 *   aggregation: [0, 200],
 *   change: {
 *     ratio: 2000,
 *     amount: 200
 *   },
 *   entities: {
 *     service: [
 *       {
 *         id: 'service-a',
 *         aggregation: [0, 100],
 *         change: {
 *           ratio: 100,
 *           amount: 100
 *         },
 *         entities: {}
 *       },
 *       {
 *         id: 'service-b',
 *         aggregation: [0, 100],
 *         change: {
 *           ratio: 100,
 *           amount: 100
