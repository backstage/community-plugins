# @backstage-community/plugin-graphiql

This plugin integrates [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) as a tool to browse GraphiQL endpoints inside Backstage.

The purpose of the plugin is to provide a convenient way for developers to try out GraphQL queries in their own environment.
By exposing GraphiQL as a plugin instead of a standalone app, it's possible to provide a preconfigured environment for engineers, and also tie into authentication providers already inside Backstage.

## Getting Started

### Installing the plugin

Start out by installing the plugin in your Backstage app:

```bash
# From your Backstage root directory
yarn --cwd packages/app add @backstage-community/plugin-graphiql
```

```diff
# in packages/app/src/App.tsx
+import { GraphiQLPage } from '@backstage-community/plugin-graphiql';

 const routes = (
   <FlatRoutes>
+    <Route path="/graphiql" element={<GraphiQLPage />} />
```

### Adding GraphQL endpoints

For the plugin to function, you need to supply GraphQL endpoints through the GraphQLBrowse API. This is done by implementing the `graphQlBrowseApiRef` exported by this plugin.

If all you need is a static list of endpoints, the plugin exports a `GraphQLEndpoints` class that implements the `GraphQLBrowseApi` for you. Here's an example of how you could expose two GraphQL endpoints in your App:

```diff
# in packages/app/src/apis.ts
+import {
+  graphQlBrowseApiRef,
+  GraphQLEndpoints,
+} from '@backstage-community/plugin-graphiql';

  export const apis = [
+   createApiFactory({
+     api: graphQlBrowseApiRef,
+     deps: { errorApi: errorApiRef, githubAuthApi: githubAuthApiRef },
+     factory: ({ errorApi, githubAuthApi }) =>
+       GraphQLEndpoints.from([
+         // Use the .create function if all you need is a static URL and headers.
+         GraphQLEndpoints.create({
+           id: 'gitlab',
+           title: 'GitLab',
+           url: 'https://gitlab.com/api/graphql',
+           // Optional extra headers
+           headers: { Extra: 'Header' },
+         }),
+         {
+           id: 'hooli-search',
+           title: 'Hooli Search',
+           // Custom fetch function, this one is equivalent to using GraphQLEndpoints.create()
+           // with url set to https://internal.hooli.com/search
+           fetcher: async (params: any) => {
+             return fetch('https://internal.hooli.com/search', {
+               method: 'POST',
+               headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
+               body: JSON.stringify(params),
+             }).then(res => res.json());
+           },
+         }
+       ]),
+   }),
```
