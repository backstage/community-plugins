# Catalog Backend Module for Scaffolder Relation Catalog Processor

This is an extension module to the catalog-backend plugin, providing an additional catalog entity processor that adds a new relation that depends on the `spec.scaffoldedFrom` field to link scaffolder templates and the catalog entities they generated.

## Getting Started

1. Install the scaffolder relation catalog processor module using the following command:

   ```console
   yarn workspace backend add @backstage-community/plugin-catalog-backend-module-scaffolder-relation-processor
   ```

### Installing on the new backend system

To install this module into the [new backend system](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/), add the following into the `packages/backend/src/index.ts` file:

```ts title="packages/backend/src/index.ts
const backend = createBackend();

// highlight-add-start
backend.add(
  import(
    '@backstage-community/plugin-catalog-backend-module-scaffolder-relation-processor'
  ),
);
// highlight-add-end

backend.start();
```

### Usage

Catalog entities containing the `spec.scaffoldedFrom` field will have a relation link be formed between it and the `template` corresponding to the entity ref in the `spec.scaffoldedFrom` field.

This link can be viewed in the `relations` field of the Raw YAML view of a catalog entity when inspecting an entity. In the entity with the `spec.scaffoldedFrom` field, the relation type is `scaffoldedFrom` with a target pointing to the value of the `spec.scaffoldedFrom` field. Conversely, for the target template, it will have a relation type of `ScaffolderOf` with a target pointing to the entity with the `spec.scaffoldedFrom` field.

These relations should also appear on the `EntityCatalogGraphView` component from the `@backstage/plugin-catalog-graph` package (only if the entity corresponding to the entity ref exists in the catalog).
