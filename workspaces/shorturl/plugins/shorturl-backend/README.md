# shorturl-backend

Welcome to the shorturl-backend backend plugin!

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn
start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/shorturl-backend/health](http://localhost:7007/api/shorturl-backend/health).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.

## Configuration

This plugin has optional configuration options that can be set in the `app-config.yaml` file.

```yaml
shorturl:
  length: 6 # default: 8
  alphabet: 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ # default: A-Za-z0-9_-
```

## Testing
