 * @remarks
 *
 * The Gitlab API can only return the job (sub-stage) of a pipeline and not a whole stage
 * The job does return from which stage it is
 * So, for the stage name we use the parent stage name and in the sub-stages we add the current job
 * In the end the cicd-statistics plugin will calculate the right durations for each stage
 *
 * Furthermore, we don't add the job to the sub-stage if it is has the same name as the parent stage
 * We then assume that the stage has no sub-stages
