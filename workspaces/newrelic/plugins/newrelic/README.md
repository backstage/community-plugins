## Getting Started

This plugin uses the Backstage proxy to securely communicate with New Relic's
APIs.

1.  Add the following to your `app-config.yaml` to enable this configuration:

    ```yaml
    proxy:
      '/newrelic/apm/api':
        target: https://api.newrelic.com/v2
        headers:
          X-Api-Key: ${NEW_RELIC_REST_API_KEY}
        allowedHeaders:
          - link
    ```

    There is some types of api key on new relic, to this use must be `User` type of key, In your production deployment of Backstage, you would also need to ensure that
    you've set the `NEW_RELIC_REST_API_KEY` environment variable before starting
    the backend.

    While working locally, you may wish to hard-code your API key in your
    `app-config.local.yaml` like this:

    ```yaml
    # app-config.local.yaml
    proxy:
      '/newrelic/apm/api':
        headers:
          X-Api-Key: NRRA-YourActualApiKey
        allowedHeaders:
          - link
    ```

    Read more about how to find or generate this key in
    [New Relic's Documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#rest-api-key).

    See if it's working by visiting the New Relic Plugin Path:
    [/newrelic](http://localhost:3000/newrelic)

2.  Add a dependency to your `packages/app/package.json`:
    ```sh
    # From your Backstage root directory
    yarn --cwd packages/app add @backstage-community/plugin-newrelic
    ```
3.  Add the `NewRelicPage` to your `packages/app/src/App.tsx`:

    ```tsx
    <FlatRoutes>
      â€¦
      <Route path="/newrelic" element={<NewRelicPage />} />
    </FlatRoutes>
    ```

4.  Add link to New Relic to your sidebar

    ```typescript
    // packages/app/src/components/Root/Root.tsx
     import ExtensionIcon from '@material-ui/icons/ExtensionOutlined';

     ...

     export const Root = ({ children }: PropsWithChildren<{}>) => (
       <SidebarPage>
         <Sidebar>
           ...
           <SidebarItem icon={ExtensionIcon} to="newrelic" text="New Relic" />
           ...
         </Sidebar>
       </SidebarPage>
     );

    ```

5.  Navigate to your.domain.com/newrelic.

    At this step you must be able to see a page like that

## Features

- View New Relic Application Performance Monitoring (APM) data such as:
  - Application Name
  - Response Time (ms)
  - Throughput (rpm)
  - Error Rate
  - Instance Count
  - Apdex Score

## Limitations

- Currently only supports New Relic APM data

---

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
