      One obvious way of scaling applications is to throw more money at them. And it works amazingly well â€” add a few more servers, upgrade your database server, and voila, a lot of the performance issues just go poof!
      
      But it is often also possible to scale applications without adding more servers. That's what we will discuss today.
      
      Let's get going!
