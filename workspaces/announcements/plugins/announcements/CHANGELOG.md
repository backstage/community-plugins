  ### New frontend system + @backstage/ui updates

  We are rebuilding several major components of the announcements plugin from scratch leveraging the `@backstage/ui` library. To start, the admin portal now leverages the new header component from the `@backstage/ui` library. Users who have migrated to the new frontend system will gradually receive these until the plugin is fully migrated. Users on the existing frontend system will not see any changes.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- dc3ce7f: # Major Release: Admin Portal Consolidation

  Releases the first major version of the plugin with support for two primary entry points:

  - `AnnouncementsPage` - A page that displays all announcements that end users consume
  - `AdminPortal` - A unified portal for managing announcements, categories, and tags

  With this major release, we are consolidating all functionality into the admin portal. The previous version provides individual pages for each of these entry points which have now been removed.

  As the plugin's adoption grew, more requests to hide UI components based on permissions came in. This decision was made to simplify the plugin and reduce the complexity of the codebase. It also provides a more consistent UX for admin operations and allows for more flexibility in the future.

  ## Highlights

  - The button to create a new announcement has been removed from the announcements page. This button is now only available in the admin portal.
  - The context menu has been updated to only include a link to the admin portal. Links to the individual pages for categories and tags have been removed.
  - All admin operations (create/edit announcements, manage categories, manage tags) are now accessible through a unified tabbed interface in the Admin Portal.
  - The `AnnouncementsCard` component now links to the admin portal instead of the create page.

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### Removed Routes

  The following route references have been removed and are no longer available:

  - `announcementCreateRouteRef` - Use `announcementAdminRouteRef` instead
  - `announcementEditRouteRef` - Use `announcementAdminRouteRef` instead
  - `categoriesListRouteRef` - Categories are now managed within the Admin Portal
  - `tagsListRouteRef` - Tags are now managed within the Admin Portal

  ## Translation Changes

  The following translation keys have been removed:

  - `announcementsPage.contextMenu.categories`
  - `announcementsPage.contextMenu.tags`

  The following translation keys have been updated:

  - `announcementsPage.contextMenu.admin` - Updated to "Manage announcements"

  ### Removed Components

  The following components have been removed:

  - `CreateAnnouncementPage` - Replaced by `AdminPortal` with Announcements tab
  - `EditAnnouncementPage` - Replaced by `AdminPortal` with Announcements tab
  - `CategoriesPage` - Replaced by `AdminPortal` with Categories tab
  - `TagsPage` - Replaced by `AdminPortal` with Tags tab
  - `NewCategoryDialog` - Category creation is now handled inline within the Categories tab
  - `NewTagDialog` - Tag creation is now handled inline within the Tags tab

  ## Benefits

  A big benefit of this consolidation is it reduces the amount of code we must migrate to support both the new frontend system and the new `@backstage/ui` library which we are in the process of doing. Others include:

  - Single entry point for all admin operations (`/announcements/admin`)
  - Less code to maintain - removed duplicate page components
  - Reduction in code duplication - shared form logic consolidated
  - Improved UX with tabbed interface for related admin operations
  - Better permission handling - all admin operations gated through one portal

  ## Migration Guide

  If you have custom integrations or links to the old routes, update them as follows:

  **Before:**

  ```tsx
  import { announcementCreateRouteRef } from '@backstage-community/plugin-announcements';
  const createLink = useRouteRef(announcementCreateRouteRef);
  ```

  **After:**

  ```tsx
  import { announcementAdminRouteRef } from '@backstage-community/plugin-announcements';
  const adminLink = useRouteRef(announcementAdminRouteRef);
  ```

  All admin functionality is now accessible at the `/announcements/admin` route.
