'@backstage-community/plugin-announcements': patch
---

Updates the announcements form to use `@backstage/ui` for the following components:

- Box
- Button
- InfoCard -> Card, CardBody, CardHeader
- Grid
- Typography -> Text
- Paper -> _removed_
- Divider -> _removed_

These are minor changes that do not affect the functionality of the announcements form.
