## Special thanks & Disclaimer

We want to thank K-Phoen for creating the announcement plugins found [here](https://github.com/K-Phoen/backstage-plugin-announcements). Their work has been invaluable in providing a foundation for our development efforts, and we are grateful for the time and effort they put into creating this plugin.

In the spirit of Procoreâ€™s values of openness, our focus will be on meeting our internal needs, meaning we are making changes to the plugin that are incompatible with the original. We are happy to share it with the community and welcome all pull requests and issues.
