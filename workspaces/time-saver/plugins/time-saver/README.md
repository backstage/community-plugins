This part of plugin `frontend` is responsible of providing views with charts describing data collected from `backend` part of plugin.

## Installation

1. Install the plugin package in your Backstage app:

```sh
# From your Backstage root directory
yarn workspace packages/app add @backstage-community/plugin-time-saver
```

2. Now open the `packages/app/src/App.tsx` file
3. Then after all the import statements add the following line:

   ```ts
   import { TimeSaverPage } from '@backstage-community/plugin-time-saver';
   ```

4. In this same file just before the closing `</ FlatRoutes>`, this will be near the bottom of the file, add this line:

   ```ts
   <Route path="/time-saver" element={<TimeSaverPage />} />
   ```

5. Next open the `packages/app/src/components/Root/Root.tsx` file
6. We want to add this icon import after all the existing import statements:

   ```ts
   import Timelapse from '@material-ui/icons/Timelapse';
   ```

7. Then add this line just after the `<SidebarSettings />` line:

   ```ts
   <SidebarItem icon={Timelapse} to="time-saver" text="timeSaver" />
   ```

8. Now run `yarn dev` from the root of your project and you should see the DevTools option show up just below Settings in your sidebar and clicking on it will get you to the [Info tab](#info)
9. Install [time-saver-backend](../time-saver-backend/README.md) part if not installed already

## Generate Statistics

Configure your template definition like described below:
Provide an object under `metadata`. Provide quantities of saved time by each group executing one template in **_hours_** preferably

```diff
 apiVersion: scaffolder.backstage.io/v1beta3
 kind: Template
 metadata:
     name: example-template
     title: create-github-project
     description: Creates Github project
+      substitute:
+        engineering:
+          devops: 1
+          security: 4
+          development_team: 2
 spec:
     owner: group:default/backstage-admins
     type: service
```

Scheduler is running with its default setup every **5 minutes** to generate data from executed templates with these information.

## Migration

This plugins supports backward compatibility with migration. You can specify your Time Saver metadata for each template name. Then the migration will be performed once executing the API request to `/migrate` endpoint of the plugin.

Configure your backward time savings here:

Open the `app-config.yaml` file

```yaml
ts:
  backward:
    config: |
      [
        {
          "entityRef": "template:default/create-github-project",
          "engineering": {
            "devops": 8,
            "development_team": 8,
            "security": 3
          }
        } 
      ]
    # extend this list if needed
```
