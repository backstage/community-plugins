This is your newly scaffolded Backstage App, Good Luck!

> Notice: The guest user has admin permissions in this application for quick setup. For better control, specify more users and groups in app-config.local.yaml and define a separate admin/admins permission instead of using the guest user. Using the guest user as an admin is not recommended for permission management.
