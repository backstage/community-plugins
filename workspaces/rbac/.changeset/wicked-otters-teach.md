'@backstage-community/plugin-rbac': patch

UI Enhancements:

- Added vertical spacing between buttons in the side drawer for improved usability.
- Fixed layout issue in the Users and Groups table where adding a row caused unexpected height changes.
- Aligned action icon colors in the Roles table for visual consistency.
- Simplified label formatting in the Overview table for a cleaner look.
- Improved dropdown behavior in Users, Groups, and Permissions sections — selecting an option no longer clears the input text.
- Conditionally hid input field labels when validation errors are present to reduce visual clutter.
- Aligned “No options” placeholder text across the Users and Groups and Plugin selection dropdowns.
- Prevented backspace from unintentionally removing selected items in the Users and Groups and Plugin dropdowns.
