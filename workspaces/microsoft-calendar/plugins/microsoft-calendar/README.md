1. Install the plugin by running this command

```bash
# From your Backstage root directory
yarn --cwd packages/app add @backstage-community/plugin-microsoft-calendar
```

2. Import the Microsoft calendar React component from `@backstage-community/plugin-microsoft-calendar`.
3. You can then use the provided React component `MicrosoftCalendar` in the backstage frontend where ever you want

```tsx
import { MicrosoftCalendarCard } from '@backstage-community/plugin-microsoft-calendar';

// ...
<Grid item xs={12} md={4}>
  <MicrosoftCalendarCard />
</Grid>;
// ...
```

If your homepage is not static JSX add `microsoftCalendarApiRef` to the App's `apis.ts`:

```ts
import {
  MicrosoftCalendarApiClient,
  microsoftCalendarApiRef,
} from '@backstage-community/plugin-microsoft-calendar';

  // ...
  fetchApiRef,
  // ...
} from '@backstage/core-plugin-api';

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
