# Analytics Module: Matomo Analytics

This plugin provides an opinionated implementation of the Backstage Analytics
API for Matomo Analytics. Once installed and configured, analytics events will
be sent to Matomo as your users navigate and use your Backstage instance.

This module is made to work with backstage's built-in analytics plugin. The usage guide to start tracking analytics for your plugins can be found here: https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/analytics/

## Installation

1. Install the plugin package in your Backstage app:

```sh
# From your Backstage root directory
yarn workspace app add @backstage-community/plugin-analytics-module-matomo
```

2. Wire up the API implementation to your App:

```tsx
// packages/app/src/apis.ts
import {
  analyticsApiRef,
  configApiRef,
  identityApiRef,
} from '@backstage/core-plugin-api';

import { MatomoAnalytics } from '@backstage-community/plugin-analytics-module-matomo';

export const apis: AnyApiFactory[] = [
  // Instantiate and register the Matomo Analytics API Implementation.
  createApiFactory({
    api: analyticsApiRef,
    deps: { configApi: configApiRef },
    factory: ({ configApi }) => MatomoAnalytics.fromConfig(configApi),
  }),
];
```

3. Configure the plugin in your `app-config.yaml`:

The following is the minimum configuration required to start sending analytics
events to Matomo. All that's needed is your Matomo Host and Site Id:

```yaml
# app-config.yaml
app:
  analytics:
    matomo:
      host: ${ANALYTICS_MATOMO_INSTANCE_URL}
      siteId: ${ANALYTICS_MATOMO_SITE_ID}
      identity: optional # (optional) to enable user tracking. Is disabled by default
```

4. Update CSP in your `app-config.yaml`:(optional)

The following is the minimal content security policy required to load scripts from your Matomo Instance.

```yaml
backend:
  csp:
    connect-src: ["'self'", 'http:', 'https:']
    # Add these line below
    script-src: ["'self'", "'unsafe-eval'", '${ANALYTICS_MATOMO_INSTANCE_URL}']
```
