# ADR (Architecture Decision Record) Documentation Standards

All change documentation in this directory must follow the ADR format.

## File Naming Convention

**Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD-kebab-case-description.md`

**Examples:**
- `2025-11-07-execution-plan-panel.md`
- `2025-11-07-dynamic-form-support.md`
- `2025-11-07-streaming-improvements.md`

**Rules:**
- Use the current date when creating new ADRs
- Use lowercase with hyphens (kebab-case)
- Be descriptive but concise
- Date format is strictly YYYY-MM-DD

## Required Header Structure

```markdown
# Title in Title Case

**Status**: 🟢 In-use | 🟡 Proposed | 🔴 Deprecated
**Category**: Features & Enhancements | Bug Fixes | UI/UX | Configuration & Setup
**Date**: Month DD, YYYY
```

**Status Options:**
- 🟢 **In-use** - Currently implemented and active
- 🟡 **Proposed** - Planned but not yet implemented
- 🔴 **Deprecated** - No longer in use

**Category Options:**
- Features & Enhancements
- Bug Fixes
- UI/UX

## Style Guidelines

### Formatting
- Use **bold** for emphasis
- Use `inline code` for code references
- Use ```language code blocks for examples
- Use > blockquotes for important notes
- Use - or * for bullet lists
- Use 1. 2. 3. for numbered lists

### Emoji Indicators
Use emojis to enhance readability:
- ✅ Success, done, working
- ❌ Error, not working, removed
- 🟢 Active status
- 🟡 Pending/proposed status
- 🔴 Deprecated status
- 📋 Todo, checklist
- 🎯 Goal, target
- 🎨 UI/UX related
- 🔧 Configuration
- 🧪 Testing
- 📚 Documentation
- 🚀 Deployment, release
- ⚠️ Warning, caution
- 💬 Chat, messaging
- 📊 Data, analytics

### Code Examples
Always include:
- Syntax highlighting (```typescript, ```tsx, ```javascript, etc.)
- Context (what component, what file)
- Comments explaining key parts

### UI/UX Documentation
- Include before/after comparisons
- Show user interaction flows
- Document state changes
- Explain visual design decisions

### Tables
Use tables for comparisons:
```markdown
| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Panel display | Static | Dynamic updates |
```

### Language
- Write in present tense
- Be clear and concise
- Explain "what" and "why", not just "how"
- Assume reader has React/TypeScript context
- Define acronyms on first use

## Example ADR Structure
