'@backstage-community/plugin-servicenow': minor
---

Added support for the new frontend system.

The plugin automatically adds a "ServiceNow" tab to a software catalog entity if the entity has an `servicenow.com/entity-id` annotation.

It does not add the "My ServiceNow Tickets" tab to the user entity for now.
