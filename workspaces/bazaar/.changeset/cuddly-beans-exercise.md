'@backstage-community/plugin-bazaar': patch
---

Catalog Entities can be passed all the way through to the HomePageBazaarInfoCard so custom entities are maintained when opening the Link Entity menu
OR
A custom filter can be passed in to bazaar components to override the default filter in fetchCatalogItems.
