'@backstage-community/plugin-topology': patch
---

- Fixed an issue with the topology node badge icon text color.
- Updated the stylesheet link filter string to accommodate the new topology package name.
- Removed `janus-idp/cli` from `devDependencies` as `export-dynamic` is no longer needed for the topology plugin package.
