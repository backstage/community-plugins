# Setting up the development environment for Topology plugin

In [Backstage plugin terminology](https://backstage.io/docs/local-dev/cli-build-system#package-roles), the Topology plugin is a front-end plugin. You can start a live development session from the repository root using the following command:

```console
yarn workspace @backstage-community/plugin-topology run start
```
