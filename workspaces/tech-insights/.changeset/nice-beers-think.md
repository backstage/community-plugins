Added support for alternate visualizations of boolean checks:

- Content lists can be rendered with smaller text size and reduced padding (option `dense`)
- Checks in the overview page can be rendered as a badge (option `badge`)
- Checks in the entity card can be rendered as a gauge (option `gauge`)
