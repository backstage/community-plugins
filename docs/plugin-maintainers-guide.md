## Maintaining and patching an older release line

It may be necessary to patch a prior release line of a plugin when users depend on an older, but stable version and while a newer, incompatible, major version of the plugin exists. Typically for these older releases, only major bugs and security issues will need to be remediated. Not every plugin will need this workflow.

This guide will describe the steps needed to release on an older version.

### Patching an older release

When patching an older release, follow the steps below to ensure the correct workflow is applied:

1. Request a `workspace/${workspace}` branch by asking one of the [@backstage/community-plugins-maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/backstage/teams/community-plugins-maintainers).

   - Ensure that a branch named `workspace/${workspace}` exists, with appropriate branch protections in place. This branch will be used for patch releases.
   - The `${workspace}` should correspond to the specific plugin or component you are patching.

2. Reset the `workspace` branch:

   - Reset the `workspace/${workspace}` branch to the version of the plugin you need to patch.
   - You can use the autogenerated version tags from previous releases to pinpoint the prior release version to apply the patch.

3. Apply your commits:

   - Apply the necessary patch fixes or security updates.
   - Do not manually bump the version in `package.json`. The version bump must be handled via changesets.

4. Submit a PR following the required workflow:

   - Open a pull request with your changes against the `workspace/${workspace}` branch.
   - Ensure the PR:
     - Contains only necessary fixes.
     - Includes a changeset.

5. Merge the PR to trigger the release workflow:

   - The PR must meet these conditions to be merged:
     - The PR title starts with "Version Packages" (automatically generated by changesets).
     - The PR originates from a `maintenance-changesets-release/${workspace}` branch.
     - The PR is authored by `backstage-service`.
     - The PR is merged, not just closed.
   - Once merged, the release workflow will automatically trigger, building and publishing the new release.

6. Confirm the release:
   - Once the workflow completes, a new version will be published.
   - A new Git tag will be created, which can be used for future patches.
   - The release will be tagged as "maintenance" in the package registry to avoid overwriting latest stable versions.
