# Backstage Compatibility

![Dynamic JSON Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fversions.backstage.io%2Fv1%2Ftags%2Fmain%2Fmanifest.json&query=%24.releaseVersion&label=Latest%20Backstage%20Version)

The following table lists what version of Backstage each workspace is currently compatible with. The Backstage version listed for each workspace is determined by looking at the `backstage.json` file at the root of each workspace. The badges are using the [Shields.io Dynamic JSON Badge](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-json-badge) feature and are kept up to date automatically (when the page loads it will do this check against the file as it is on the `main` branch).

> [!NOTE]
> This table was built via script but needs to be ran manually if new workspaces are added.
